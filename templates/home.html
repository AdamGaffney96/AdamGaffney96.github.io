                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello there and thank you for looking over my resume and portfolio! My name is Adam Gaffney and I am a 24 year old coding enthusiast from Scotland. My main job 
                        is in the field of Data Analytics and Management, however I love learning in my spare time, and so I am taking courses to learn both spoken and coding languages. 
                        I find that coding is something I have always had an interest in but never considered as a career path until recently. In our technologically driven world, there 
                        is never a bad time to start learning how to code, and I am already seeing benefits in my career, through R, Python and SQL.
                        <br><br>
                        On this site, I shall show both my personal and professional qualities, going through my work experience and education, as well as a portfolio of all the work 
                        I have completed. This portfolio will be mainly coding, however I am also including my final year disseration, and any other major projects I decide to take on. 
                        I hope to use this as a good reference point for future web development, as well as a record of all the work I have completed, and hopefully as I learn more, 
                        this website will begin to look better and more fleshed out.
